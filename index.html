                <ul class="space-y-3 mt-4 custom-list pl-4">
                    <li><strong>Discovering Spots:</strong> You must find hangout locations yourself. Discover them by exploring the world, overhearing NPC conversations ("Did you hear about the old abandoned building?"), or getting tips from trusted friends.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scouting:</strong> Once a potential spot is found, you can "Scout" it. This reveals its properties: capacity (how many people can fit), privacy level (chance of being busted by cops or parents), and available activities (e.g., a beach has a fire pit, a house has a sound system).</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Chemistry:</strong> A successful hangout requires a compatible group. Inviting a Jock and a Nerd to the same small hangout might lower the fun for everyone, damaging your reputation.</li>

                        <li><strong>Mowing Lawns:</strong> A top-down view of the lawn appears. You must guide the mower along a highlighted path. Going off-path reduces your pay. Hitting obstacles like flowerbeds or garden gnomes results in no pay and a reputation loss with the homeowner. Upgrading to a ride-on mower increases speed but makes tight turns harder.</li>
                        <li><strong>Washing Cars:</strong> The vehicle is presented with a "dirt map" overlay. You control a cleaning tool to scrub off the dirt. A timer ticks down. The goal is to clean the car as evenly and quickly as possible. Better performance earns a bigger tip. New tools (power washer, better sponges) can be purchased to increase efficiency.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tutoring:</strong> When you accept, you meet the student at lunch. A series of simple puzzles (math problems, word scrambles) appears. The difficulty depends on the student's clique (e.g., tutoring a Jock is easier than a Nerd). Completing it successfully gives you cash and a relationship boost.</li>

                        <li><strong>Flipping Items:</strong> Use an "eBuy-like" app to buy items that change every few days. NPCs will have thought bubbles showing an item they want, which you can then find or buy and sell to them for a profit.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Bully (Intimidation Mechanic):</strong> Once your reputation is high enough, you unlock aggressive dialogue options. When talking to an NPC, you can choose intimidating lines to raise their "Intimidation" meter. If the meter is full when you ask for their lunch money, they'll give it to you. If you fail, you lose social standing from embarrassment. Doing this too often risks getting caught by teachers.</li>

                    <p class="text-gray-300">You can't keep everything in your backpack. You must manage your illicit items across a network of hiding spots. Your "Stash" menu shows a list of known spots, their inventory capacity, and a risk percentage. A high-risk spot (under your bed) is convenient but checked often. A low-risk spot (a loose brick behind the gym) is safer but harder to access. If a stash is found, you lose the items and gain a "Suspicion" debuff with your parents or the school, leading to more frequent searches.</p>

                        <li><strong>Breathing Game:</strong> A vertical bar appears with a "calm zone". A meter rises and falls with your breath (holding and releasing a key). You must keep the meter inside the zone for a set duration. Being too erratic causes a fail.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stand Still Game:</strong> To prove you can walk straight, a sequence of keys (W, A, S, D) appears. You must press them in the correct order before a timer runs out. The sequences get longer and faster the more intoxicated you are.</li>
                        <li><strong>Delete Emails Game:</strong> A three-stage challenge. 1) Sneak past family members without being seen. 2) At the computer, a minigame starts where you must identify the four most-used keys by finding fingerprints to guess the password. 3) Once logged in, you have 60 seconds to find and delete incriminating emails from the inbox before a parent walks in.</li>

            <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-xl space-y-4">
                <p><strong>Alcohol:</strong> Overhear students talking about fake IDs to get a lead on the ID Maker (a Nerd). They'll ask you to complete a fetch quest (e.g., steal a specific textbook from the library). Once you deliver, you can buy a fake ID. Using it at a store might trigger a random "Nerve" check minigame.</p>
                <p><strong>Weed:</strong> Build your reputation with the Druggie or Roadmen cliques. They'll eventually give you a tip on a dealer's location and the time they operate. Meet the dealer and pass a "vibe check" dialogue. Consistent purchases build loyalty, unlocking better prices and more potent strains.</p>
                <p><strong>Shrooms:</strong> Become "Best Friends" with a weed dealer. During a specific in-game week, they'll mention a special "harvest" is available, giving you a limited window to purchase.</p>
                <p><strong>Molly:</strong> Requires a very high social standing with a specific party-promoter Jock. You'll need to help them successfully pull off a party (a questline involving distributing flyers and setting up gear). As a reward, they'll give you their supplier's contact.</p>
                <p><strong>LSD & DMT:</strong> Max out your loyalty with your main weed dealer. They'll give you a cryptic note. Solve the riddle to find a reclusive dealer in a hidden location (like deep in the Woods). This dealer only sells LSD. After building a high standing with them through several expensive purchases, they will finally offer you DMT as a sign of ultimate trust.</p>
